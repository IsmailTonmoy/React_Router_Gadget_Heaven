# Handling and Managing Data

### In this project, data is managed using the React Context API, which provides a robust solution for state management in React applications. The Context API allows for the creation of a centralized store where data can be shared and accessed by multiple components across the application, eliminating the need to pass props manually through deeply nested component trees.
